<h2>outboard motor</h2>

<p>
Your boat is equipped with a speedy outboard motor, you manoeuvre your boat with the keyboard:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>to move forward press the UP arrow or W key</li>
<li>to reverse press the DOWN arrow or S key</li>
<li>to turn your boat press the LEFT/RIGHT arrows or A/D keys</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Your outboard will start automatically as you begin to move, and it will cut off automatically when you idle in-place for a few seconds.
</p>

<h2>trolling motor</h2>

<p>
Your trolling motor is good for moving quietly, at the cost of moving much slower. Click on the trolling motor button or press the T key to toggle between trolling and outboard.
</p>

<h2>avoid obstacles</h2>

<p>
It is best to avoid land, you have an outboard, not a hovercraft. Running aground costs you valuable fishing time while you dislodge your vessel, not to mention the noise scares the fish!

<p>
Rocks and logs also resist any attempts at ramming them with your boat, so don't go tilting at windmills either, lest nearby fishermen think you had one too many.

<p>
Aquatic plants on the water's surface, on the other hand, are fine to traverse.

<p>
Try to steer clear of fellow competitors, a collision only costs time and money and you might find a disgruntled competitor trying to hook your hat as you part ways.
