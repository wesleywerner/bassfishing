====== tackle ======

You have half a dozen rods and a tackle box of multifarious colored lures - a compliment usually found in dreams or games. So use it wisely!

* Use the "rods" button on-screen or press the R key to select a rod
* Use the "lures" button on-screen or press the L key to set a lure

===== rods =====

The range of your cast is limited by the length of the rod and the line test. A lighter test line casts further as it gives less air resistance, combined with a longer rod for the reach.

===== lures =====

If you don't have a rod selected, you will be asked to pick one first. If you select a rod that does not have a lure, you will open your tackle box and pick a lure automatically.

Setting a lure takes fishing time, so once you have a couple of rods set, switch between them to quickly cast with different lures.


===== casting =====

Use your mouse cursor to aim, and click the mouse button to cast.

Casting in open water, into aquatic vegetation, and around rocks and logs is a good bet. Aiming for land, however, is not. Your lure can snag and you will lose it, costing yet more time retying a new one.
