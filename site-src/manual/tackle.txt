====== tackle ======
You have half a dozen rods and a tackle box full of lures.

* Click the "Rods" button or press the R key to select a rod
* Click the "Lures" button or press the L key to set a lure

===== rods =====

Your rods have varying cast ranges, and once a rod has a lure set you can quickly switch between rods without retying a lure.

===== lures =====
Lures are categorized by action: crankbaits, spinnerbaits, surface baits and worms. Scroll the list with the mouse wheel, click the lure you want and click the lure color.

If you don't have a rod selected when you open your tackle box, you will be asked to pick one first.

===== casting =====
Use your mouse cursor to aim, and click the mouse button to cast.

Casting into aquatic vegetation or around rocks and logs is a good bet. Aiming for land is not. Your lure can snag and you will lose it, costing you time while tying a new one.
